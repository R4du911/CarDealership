# Car-Dealership

What I learnt from this project:
- more polymorphism
- MVC architecture
- Maven POM.xml and dependencies
- JDBC and Microsoft SQL Server

A car dealership needs an application where customers can log in to buy merchandise (cars or parts).
This application is also connected to a database saved in Microsoft SQL Server with the help of Maven and JDBC.
Additionally, the application also implements JUnit Test.

1. The application allows customers to purchase merchandise, either a specific car or a specific part.

2. The application offers a shopping basket system, where the customer can select which cars or parts he would like to buy.

3. With the application you can see the available merchandise (cars and parts) and their purchase price.

4. The application allows viewing of cars and parts owned by a customer.

5. Any customer can buy merchandise (cars and parts) as long as they have money for it. If the customer wants to buy a car or part but does not have money for    it, they will get an error message and the car/part will not be added to their order list.

6. The application offers the possibility to order several cars/parts in one order.

7. One can filter the cars by being able to see the cars cheaper than a certain price or by being able to see the cheapest car.
